👋 Hi, I’m @n3xtChanc3

👀 I’m interested in programming and technology, with a focus on C/C++, Python, Linux, and bash scripting. I'm also curious about exploring new frameworks and tools to enhance my skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning new programming concepts and techniques, as well as diving deeper into open-source projects to contribute and collaborate with the community.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and challenging projects related to software development, automation, or anything that aligns with my interests.
